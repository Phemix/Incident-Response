Browser Header Notes
- HSTS (Hypertext Strict Transport Security) forces the use of HTTPS and applies TOFU (Trust on First Use)
 * max-age means insecure requests cannot be made till that time expires
- HPKP (HTTP Public Key Pinning): Accepts valid certs and adheres to certain criteria, relies on TOFU, whitelist allowable certs for the domain
 * Has parameters - Public-Key-Pins, pin-sha256, max-age; includeSubdomains
- For browser compatibility, check caniuse.com
- Content Security Policy (CSP) - determines what your site can run
 * Can only load sites from HTTPS
 * Operates like a whitelist
 * can work report only (start points so stuff is not broken)
 
- securityheaders.io can scan and give reports on a site
- report-uri.io/home/analyze to analyze CSP pretty well
- report-uri.io/home/generate can generate a CSP policy
